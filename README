This is a simple MediaWiki extension created specifically for the UESP.net wiki to display a list of
wiki pages sorted by number of hits in the past few hours. This extension only displays the list...the 
actual collection of data is a multi-step process handled externally.

The basic steps are:

	1. Web server logs to an Apache format log file.
	2. Script parses log file to collect page counts.
	3. Another script saves page counts to a custom wiki table in the database.
	4. This extension reads table and outputs results. 

A general setup guide is listed below.

 - Turn on logging in your Apache/Squid/Varnish/Lighttpd/Nginx/... web server. It can be any format but
   the example scripts use an Apache log compatible format. Technically it just needs to list the page
   name/URL and have a timestamp.
 - Setup a script to parse the log files (see scripts/uesp-squidlogpagecounts for an example). This script
   should output 2 files.
       1. pagecounts.txt holds 2 columns of data seperated by a space. First column is an integer and 
          second column is the wiki page name. For example:
          
              3058 Main Page
               816 Skyrim:Skyrim
               737 Special:RecentChanges
               540 Skyrim:Quests
               ...
               
       2. pagetime.txt holds a single number which represents the number of seconds the pagecounts.txt 
          data represents.
 - The script should parse several hours or days of logs to give a reasonable sample size. For a very busy
   wiki several hours would be enough. For a less busy one several days/weeks of logs may be needed.
 - Setup a script to read the pagecounts.txt file and insert them into the wiki.popularPageCounts table
   (see scripts/uesp-savesquidpagecounts.php for an example).
 - Install the extension as any other MediaWiki extension by adding a line:
       wfLoadExtension( "UespShortLinks" );
   to your LocalSettings.php file.
 - Test extension by visiting https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Special:RecentPopularPages on your wiki. Remember
   the extension only displays the current data in the popularPageCounts table.
